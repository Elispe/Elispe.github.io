I am postdoctoral fellow in Dall’Anese’s group, in the Electrical, Energy and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Colorado, Boulder. She received her PhD and master degree in physics from Uppsala University, Sweden and her bachelor degree from Turin University. As a Schmidt Science Fellow, Elisabetta has pivoted from physics to energy engineering to address renewable energy integration and vehicle-grid integration for future, sustainable urban mobility. Elisabetta  is committed to explore creative, data-driven smart grid solutions to meet the growing electricity demand, while minimizing the impact on the environment. 

Short Bio
------
I am a Postdoc Fellow in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a Schmidt Science Fellow, I am pivoting from Physics to Electrical Engineering. Before joining UC Boulder, I received my PhD and M.Sc. in Physics from Uppsala University, Sweden, and I completed my B.Sc. in Physics at Turin University, Italy. I also developed software for multiphysics simulations in the Electromagnetics team at COMSOL, Inc.
