Short Bio
------
I am a Postdoc Fellow in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a Schmidt Science Fellow, I am pivoting from Physics to Electrical Engineering. Before joining UC Boulder, I received my PhD and M.Sc. in Physics from Uppsala University, Sweden, and I completed my B.Sc. in Physics at Turin University, Italy. I also developed software for multiphysics simulations in the Electromagnetics team at COMSOL, Inc.
