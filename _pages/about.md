I am a [Schmidt Science](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a Schmidt Science Fellow, I am pivoting from Physics to Electrical Engineering. Before joining CU Boulder, I received my PhD and M.Sc. in Physics from Uppsala University, Sweden, and I completed my B.Sc. in Physics at Turin University, Italy. I also developed software for multiphysics simulations in the Electromagnetics team at COMSOL, Inc.
[comment]: <> (I develop optimization and control algorithms to allow high penetration of renewable energy without compromising the reliability of the power infrastructure.  vehicle-grid integration for future, sustainable urban mobility. Elisabetta  is committed to explore creative, data-driven smart grid solutions to meet the growing electricity demand, while minimizing the impact on the environment.) 

My work and research

I enjoy multidisciplinary research.

Short Bio
------
Elisabetta Perotti is a Schmidt Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. Before joining CU, she obtained her PhD in Physics from Uppsala University. Elisabetta’s research interests span multiple fields, from theoretical hadron physics to applied mathematics. Her current work focuses on the development of optimization and control algorithms that can be deployed in networked systems such as transportation systems, power grids, and data centers. 

Recent news

- \[May 24\] Our preprint [Incremental Volt/Var Control for Distribution Networks via Chance-Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02511) proposes a decentralized,  incremental Volt/Var control strategy for voltage regulation in distribution networks. Cost savings can be achieved in a controlled, predictable way by tolerating a prescribed probability of voltage violations.
- \[Sept 23\] Our paper [Renewable-based charging in green ride-sharing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42042-z) showcases how power utility companies and ride-sharing platforms can interact to promote renewable-based EV charging, towards a more sustainable urban mobility model.
- \[May 23\] My [inteview](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2023/05/24/cu-boulder-postdoc-leads-research-decarbonization-transportation-sector-through-ev-ride) for the CU Boulder College of Engineering is a great summary of my first year spent at CU Boulder, as a Schmidt Science Postdoctoral Fellow.
