I am a [Schmidt Science](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. Before joining CU Boulder, I received my PhD and M.Sc. in Physics from Uppsala University, Sweden, and I completed my B.Sc. in Physics at Turin University, Italy. I also have work experience as software developer for multiphysics simulations in the Electromagnetics team at COMSOL, Inc. I have a broad background in physics, with specialization in theoretical hadron physics. 

As a Schmidt Science Fellow, I am now focusing on more applied problems. My current focus is on designing optimization and control algorithms that can be implemented in networked systems such as transportation and energy systems. 

Short bio
------
Elisabetta Perotti is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Division of Energy Technology, Department of Space, Earth and Environment at
Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. From 2022 to 2024, she was a Schmidt Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the
Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering (ECEE), University of Colorado Boulder. She received her PhD in Physics from Uppsala University, Sweden. Elisabetta’s research interests span multiple fields, from theoretical hadron physics to applied mathematics. Her current research focuses on control, optimization and modeling of electrical distribution systems and transportation networks.

- \[Jan 25\] I received the Fall 2024 PAC Research Grant.
- \[Oct 24\] Best Elevator Pitch at the Front Range Industry and Postdoc Summit (FRIPS) 2024.
- \[Oct 24\] Best paper award at IEEE ISGT Europe for our contribution [A Robust Incremental Volt/VAR Control for Distribution Networks](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/322798). 
- \[May 24\] Our paper [Incremental Volt/Var Control for Distribution Networks via Chance-Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02511) proposes a decentralized,  incremental Volt/Var control strategy for voltage regulation in distribution networks. Cost savings can be achieved in a controlled, predictable way by tolerating a prescribed probability of voltage violations.
- \[Sept 23\] Our paper [Renewable-based charging in green ride-sharing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42042-z) showcases how power utility companies and ride-sharing platforms can interact to promote renewable-based EV charging, towards a more sustainable urban mobility model.
