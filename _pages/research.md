Background
------
I am a physicist by training, and most of my past research work belongs to the field of particle physics. I investigated the electromagnetic properties of a certain type of hadrons, known as hyperons, to improve our knowledge of the fundamental structure of baryonic matter and to address the open question of the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in our Universe.

After my PhD, my research interest shifted towards larger energy systems - from hadrons to our planet - and I  decided to pursue a pivot in my primary research direction. I enjoy multidisciplinary research, and my goal is to integrate disciplines like physics and math, in which I have a strong background, with computer science, data science and engineering, to tackle pressing global challenges with real-world applications. 

CurrentÂ focus
------
Electrification is critical for reducing emissions and to ensure a sustainable energy transition. So, how can we satisfy the growing electricity demand, while minimizing the impact on the environment? 
My research combines tools from optimization, control theory, and learning to advance sustainability in practical applications, such as:
- Urban mobility
  - Mobility on Demand systems and electrified transportation
  - smart charging
  - vehicle-grid integration
- Power and energy systems
  - integration of distributed energy resources
  - high penetration of renewable energy sources
