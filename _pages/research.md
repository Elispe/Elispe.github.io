Background
------
I am a physicst by training, and most of my past research work belongs to the field of particle physics. I investigated the electromagnetic properties of a certain type of hadrons, known as hyperons, to improve our knowledge of the fundamental structure of baryonic matter and to address the open question of the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in our Universe.

After my PhD, my research interest shifted towards larger energy systems - from hadrons to our planet - and I  decided to pursue a pivot in my primary research direction. I enjoy multidisciplinary research, and my goal is to integrate disciplines like physics and math, in which I have a strong background, with computer science, data science and engineering, to tackle pressing global challenges with real-world applications.
